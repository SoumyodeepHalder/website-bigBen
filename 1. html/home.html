                    <h1>Great Bell</h1>
                    <p>The main bell, officially known as the Great Bell but better known as Big Ben, is the largest
                        bell in the tower and part of the Great Clock of Westminster. It sounds an E-natural.[70]
                        The original bell was a 16 ton (16.3-tonne) hour bell, cast on 6 August 1856 in Stockton-on-Tees
                        by John Warner & Sons.[3] It is thought that the bell was originally to be called Victoria or
                        Royal Victoria in honour of Queen Victoria, but that an MP suggested the bell's current nickname
                        of "Big Ben" during a Parliamentary debate; the comment is not recorded in Hansard.[71]
                        Since the tower was not yet finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard but, during
                        testing, it cracked beyond repair and a replacement had to be made. The bell was recast on 10
                        April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 13.5-ton (13.76-tonne) bell.[3][72] The second
                        bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with
                        crowds cheering its progress; it was then pulled 200 ft (61.0 m) up to the Clock Tower's belfry,
                        a feat that took 18 hours.</p>

                    <h1>Nickname</h1>
                    <p>The origin of the nickname Big Ben is the subject of some debate. The nickname was applied first
                        to the Great Bell; it may have been named after Sir Benjamin Hall, who oversaw the installation
                        of the Great Bell, or after English heavyweight boxing champion Benjamin Caunt.[3][74][75] Now
                        Big Ben is often used, by extension, to refer to the clock, the tower and the bell collectively,
                        although the nickname is not universally accepted as referring to the clock and tower.[76] Some
                        authors of works about the tower, clock and bell sidestep the issue by using the words Big Ben
                        first in the title, then going on to clarify that the subject of the book is the clock and tower
                        as well as the bell</p>

                    <h1>Chimes</h1>
                    <p>Along with the Great Bell, the belfry houses four quarter bells which play the Westminster
                        Quarters on the quarter hours. The four quarter bells sound G♯, F♯, E, and B. They were cast by
                        John Warner & Sons at their Crescent Foundry in 1857 (G♯, F♯ and B) and 1858 (E). The Foundry
                        was in Jewin Crescent, in what is now known as The Barbican, in the City of London.[78] The
                        bells are sounded by hammers pulled by cables coming from the link room—a low-ceiling space
                        between the clock room and the belfry—where they are triggered by cables coming from the chime
                        train.[18] The quarter bells play a once-repeating, 20-note sequence of rounds and four changes
                        in the key of E major: 1–4 at quarter past, 5–12 at half past, 13–20 and 1–4 at quarter to, and
                        5–20 on the hour (which sounds 25 seconds before the main bell tolls the hour). Because the low
                        bell (B) is struck twice in quick succession, there is not enough time to pull a hammer back,
                        and it is supplied with two wrench hammers on opposite sides of the bell. The tune is that of
                        the Cambridge Chimes, first used for the chimes of Great St Mary's church, Cambridge, and
                        supposedly a variation, attributed to William Crotch, based on violin phrases from the air "I
                        know that my Redeemer liveth" in Handel's Messiah.[79][80] The notional words of the chime,
                        again derived from Great St Mary's and in turn an allusion to Psalm 37:23–24, are: "All through
                        this hour/Lord be my guide/And by Thy power/No foot shall slide".[81] They are written on a
                        plaque on the wall of the clock room</p>

                <h1>Cultural significance</h1>
                <p>The clock has become a cultural symbol of the United Kingdom, particularly in the visual media. When
                    a television or film-maker wishes to indicate a generic location in the country, a popular way to do
                    so is to show an image of the tower, often with a red double-decker bus or black cab in the
                    foreground. In 2008, a survey of 2,000 people found that the tower was the most popular landmark in
                    the United Kingdom.[86] It has also been named as the most iconic film location in London.[87]The
                    sound of the clock chiming has also been used this way in audio media; the Westminster Quarters are
                    imitated by other clocks and other devices, but the sound of Big Ben is preferred as the original
                    and best. Big Ben is a focal point of New Year celebrations in the United Kingdom, with radio and
                    television stations airing its chimes to welcome the start of the New Year. To welcome in 2012, the
                    clock tower was lit with fireworks that exploded at every toll of Big Ben.[88] Similarly, on
                    Remembrance Day, the chimes of Big Ben are broadcast to mark the 11th hour of the 11th day of the
                    11th month and the start of the two minutes' silence.</p>
